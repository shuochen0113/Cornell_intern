# Smith-Waterman Algorithm: CPU vs GPU Implementation Benchmark

## Project Overview
This project implements and benchmarks optimized Smith-Waterman sequence alignment algorithms using both CPU and GPU architectures. The implementation focuses on:

- Comparative performance analysis between naive CPU and GPU-accelerated approaches
- Biological sequence alignment validation with traceback functionality
- Scalability testing from small-scale (100bp) to genome-scale (12,000bp) sequences
